## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens Automatically:

âœ… Installs everything  
âœ… Sets up the database  
âœ… Builds the app  
âœ… Deploys to a URL like `ice-fleet.vercel.app`  
âœ… Auto-deploys when you push to GitHub  

## ðŸ“± Test Data

After deployment, the app comes with sample data already loaded:
- Test vehicles
- Sample drivers  
- Demo maintenance records

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

**Database URL looks like this:**
```
postgresql://user:password@host.com:5432/dbname
```

**Still stuck?** The app works even without a database for testing - it'll use mock data!

**That's literally it. No Docker, no complex setup, no BS. Just deploy and use.**
